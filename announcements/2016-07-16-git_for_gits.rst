Class outline

The class will cover the basics of creating and using a Git repository. Git is
used by many FOSS projects to manage code. It is used extensively in Arch
Linux, such as on the AUR. You can also use it to track dotfiles,
configuration, blog posts, college essays, and any textual data (and even
non-textual).

The class is also a workshop where you will get a chance to play around with a
Git repository. Please visit the following web page to sign up. You will need
