Class outline

This class is primarily focused on teaching the basic structure of PKGBUILDs:
how to read/write/modify them, handle different source types, common errors
and how to avoid them, and finally contribute them to the AUR for others to
use. Everyone is welcome to join, as long as you follow the eminently fair
rules in https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Code_of_conduct. :)

Prerequisites
=============
* Have a basic knowledge of bash and shell commands in general.
* The ability to use a text editor (e.g., nano, vim, emacs, gedit, Atom, etc.)

Teacher bio.
============

**Eschwartz** is well known for his profusion of posts to the Arch Linux Fora,
Mailing Lists, bugtracker, and IRC -- basically, anywhere that doesn't shut
the door on him first. He has been an Arch user ever since he was introduced
to Linux about four years ago, and has never looked back. He enjoys bash
scripting, ebooks, and (apparently) referring to himself in third-person.
