Duration

2 hours

Class outline
=============
The class will cover the role of kernels in a system, why you might want to
consider compiling your own, and tips for not getting lost in the configuration
process during your first Linux kernel compile.

Prerequisites
=============
While not necessary, it is useful to be familiar with ABS before taking the
class. If you are unfamiliar with PKGBUILDs, logs from past classes make an
excellent primer.

Teacher bio.
============

**jy2wong**:  I'm a university student from Canada, studying/doing research in
something involving signal processing (that lies somewhere between math and
computers). I've installed Arch Linux on my laptop about 4 times now, and the
first 3 times were in my first week of using Arch Linux (that was about 5 years
ago). I've been compiling my own kernel for the last 3 or 4 years. I think I'm
allergic to cats.
