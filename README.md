# Details on all past Arch Classroom sessions

This repository is split into three directories:
- `classlogs/` contains the IRC logs for all classes.

  These are weechat-style logs formatted with UTC dates, and named `YYYY-MM-DD-the_name_of_this_class.txt`

- `announcements/` contains the announcement notice of each class.

  Each class gets its own file named in the same style as the logs, but with a .rst extension.

  Announcements should contain the following sections:

  - Name/title, a sentence
  - Date, a datestamp
  - Duration, a number of hours
  - Class outline, a paragraph(s)
  - Prerequisites, a paragraph(s)
  - Materials, a link to a git repository containing notes and other materials for the class
  - Teacher biographies, a paragraph(s)

- `upcoming/` contains the planned announcement notices of classes that have not been held yet.

  Once the class has been held, the announcement will be moved to `announcements/`.
