2017-10-04 16:33:09	@lola	ok I will post here lol
2017-10-04 16:34:09	@lola	"there are lots of packages"
2017-10-04 16:34:23	@lola	"just below 100 thousand packages"
2017-10-04 16:34:41	@lola	"so we can check out pypy python"
2017-10-04 16:34:52	@lola	"since yesterday it grew by 70 packages"
2017-10-04 16:35:14	@lola	so you can use the site to search for a package
2017-10-04 16:35:21	@lola	pypi

2017-10-04 16:35:55	@lola	You can search for a package and see the example
2017-10-04 16:36:48	@lola	the idea is that you don't have to reinvent and write code from scratch
2017-10-04 16:37:04	@lola	you can use a python package
2017-10-04 16:37:17	@lola	here is a picture from github io
2017-10-04 16:37:47	@pulec	how is the delay?
2017-10-04 16:38:04	@lola	pypl just loaded
2017-10-04 16:38:16	@lola	I think your voice is ahead of the video
2017-10-04 16:38:43	@pulec	so lets start coding ok?
2017-10-04 16:38:45	@lola	"when you google for python you are more likely to get an answer than some other language"
2017-10-04 16:38:46	@pulec	ipython and lets go
2017-10-04 16:39:05	@lola	"always check multiple sources"
2017-10-04 16:39:40	@lola	"we can check on reddit python, it is a great resource for lots of interesting things'
2017-10-04 16:40:04	@lola	oh did you prerecord the live stream pulec ?
2017-10-04 16:40:08	@pulec	http://learnpython.org/ this is some kind of contents

2017-10-04 16:40:49	@lola	we could have used the server to stream ;)
2017-10-04 16:40:55	@pulec	no I didn't prerecord it, youtube streaming is problematic
2017-10-04 16:41:01	@lola	I see
2017-10-04 16:41:35	@lola	"so some differences, in C hello looks like this"
2017-10-04 16:41:36	@pulec	everybody have ipython or python notebook ready?
2017-10-04 16:42:02	tigrmesh	i do
2017-10-04 16:42:19	tigrmesh	i'm still looking at pypl
2017-10-04 16:42:19	@lola	yeah :)
2017-10-04 16:42:37	tigrmesh	and having huge lag
2017-10-04 16:43:14	blublin	same
2017-10-04 16:44:49	@lola	the day one notebook can get grabbed here:

2017-10-04 16:48:28	tigrmesh	i'm going to try internet on my phone.  it may be better
2017-10-04 16:54:26	tigrmesh	i missed a lot  :(
2017-10-04 16:56:34	@lola	pulec: live stream totally died
2017-10-04 16:57:19	@lola	ok I think maybe its back up
2017-10-04 16:57:24	@lola	no, died again
2017-10-04 16:57:26	@lola	:/
2017-10-04 16:57:36	@lola	up again but I just see google home page
2017-10-04 16:57:51	@pulec	ok lets have a break and split it
2017-10-04 16:58:19	tigrmesh	ok
2017-10-04 16:58:34	@lola	so anyone needs, they can do `export BROWSER=/usr/bin/google-chrome-stable` or `export BROWSER=/usr/bin/firefox` before running `jupyter notebook`
2017-10-04 16:58:46	@lola	and it will open the notebook in that browser
2017-10-04 16:59:07	@lola	well it opens the file chooser and then you can pick a notebook to open
2017-10-04 16:59:35	@pulec	there is also --browser option I thought, tigrmesh mentioned
2017-10-04 16:59:44	@pulec	lets reconfigure obs and start in a minute
2017-10-04 16:59:52	tigrmesh	  `--browser=/usr/bin/chromium`
2017-10-04 17:00:08	user1254`	live stream offline 
2017-10-04 17:00:14	@pulec	actually it seems obs is a bit overloaded, so that might explain everything :D
2017-10-04 17:00:37	@fsckd	user1254`: taking a break :)
2017-10-04 17:00:51	user1254`	ok :). tea time
2017-10-04 17:02:10	@pulec	lets have break for at least 5 minutes now, obs is catching up with the whole recording
2017-10-04 17:02:18	@pulec	sorry for not testing things properly before :-)
2017-10-04 17:03:26	@pulec	yeah, its definitelly behined and still in cache, choose to high settings :-)
2017-10-04 17:03:32	@pulec	it does not work well for longer videos
2017-10-04 17:04:02	@pulec	its 15 minutes to go, uff...
2017-10-04 17:04:07	@pulec	but it should code faster
2017-10-04 17:04:44	@pulec	so far any questions?
2017-10-04 17:05:01	@pulec	I guess you will have some after you see the last few minutes
2017-10-04 17:05:55	tigrmesh	yeah. since my question is "what happened during the last few minutes?"
2017-10-04 17:06:23	tigrmesh	should i be in ipython or jupyter notebook?
2017-10-04 17:06:35	@pulec	everybody's connection is probably ok
2017-10-04 17:06:43	@pulec	its my settings that were borked
2017-10-04 17:06:58	tigrmesh	k
2017-10-04 17:08:01	@fsckd	pulec: no worries, we learn as we go along :)
2017-10-04 17:08:20	@pulec	ono, probably 10 more minutes
2017-10-04 17:08:47	@pulec	anybody having issues keeping it 20 more minutes after 6 pm utc?
2017-10-04 17:11:27	tigrmesh	i'm ok with that.  but not much longer
2017-10-04 17:11:42	@pulec	ok
2017-10-04 17:11:59	@fsckd	pulec: you're doing well :)
2017-10-04 17:13:12	@pulec	before session #2 which could be probably in end of the october I might repeat this session in "CET Morning" which is during USA sleeping time
2017-10-04 17:13:31	@fsckd	sounds good
2017-10-04 17:13:59	@pulec	ok it seems in 6 minutes on 20, obs should catch up with itself, I will lower settings, make a new link for stream and we can continue
2017-10-04 17:15:06	tigrmesh	sounds good
2017-10-04 17:17:43	@pulec	stream should catch up with itself now, just the local recording, 150s to go
2017-10-04 17:18:52	@pulec	ono it really seems out of sync :-/
2017-10-04 17:19:08	@pulec	reminder: do a proper real test with obs first, not just 20 minutes
2017-10-04 17:19:18	user1254	pacman -Syu
2017-10-04 17:20:00	@fsckd	pulec: when you have the new link, i'll put it in the topic
2017-10-04 17:20:02	@pulec	still not done, 2 more minutes

2017-10-04 17:27:35	tigrmesh	dot and what?
2017-10-04 17:28:26	user1254	TAB
2017-10-04 17:29:25	tigrmesh	thanks
2017-10-04 17:30:35	@lola	yes, working much better
2017-10-04 17:32:02	@lola	pulec: if possible, could you amke the font larger?
2017-10-04 17:32:10	@lola	its a bit fuzzy looking at small sizes
2017-10-04 17:34:47	tigrmesh	thanks for making it bigger
2017-10-04 17:35:43	--	because is now known as typikal
2017-10-04 17:36:42	@lola	its much better :D
2017-10-04 17:54:43	tigrmesh	would you please explain the difference between `=` and `==`?
2017-10-04 17:55:59	@pulec	== is a comparisson operator

2017-10-04 17:56:21	tigrmesh	ok.  thaks
2017-10-04 17:56:26	tigrmesh	*thanks
2017-10-04 17:58:30	@lola	`2 + 2 = 4` is true and different from `2 + 2 == 4` because 4 is not literally the letters `2 + 2` so that is false
2017-10-04 17:59:01	@pulec	20 minutes to go or so
2017-10-04 17:59:17	@lola	if 2 + 2 = 4
2017-10-04 17:59:28	@lola	    print("true")
2017-10-04 17:59:32	@lola	to test it out
2017-10-04 18:00:06	@pulec	4:
2017-10-04 18:00:10	@pulec	misisng semicolon
2017-10-04 18:00:19	@lola	oh thanks :)
2017-10-04 18:09:22	tigrmesh	the first one is true, so the second never gets called
2017-10-04 18:09:36	tigrmesh	s/second/elif/
2017-10-04 18:10:01	@pulec	that is what I thought, lets test it :-)
2017-10-04 18:13:29	@pulec	good guess tigrmesh 
2017-10-04 18:17:09	@pulec	just dictionaries and lets end
2017-10-04 18:21:04	tigrmesh	k
2017-10-04 18:22:14	tigrmesh	*that's what a tuple is
2017-10-04 18:23:30	@pulec	5 minutes to go
2017-10-04 18:23:54	tigrmesh	so is a tuple a key-value pair?
2017-10-04 18:24:50	@pulec	no that is a dict
2017-10-04 18:25:11	tigrmesh	oh
2017-10-04 18:25:21	@pulec	will explain
2017-10-04 18:32:01	@pulec	so that is it
