16:23PM <Meskarune> Any topic you are interested in you should be able to use python

16:24PM <Meskarune> as it is very versatile and almost 30 years old

16:24PM <Meskarune> There are 2 verisons, python 3 and python 2

16:24PM <Meskarune> python 3.6.2 is recomended version

16:24PM <Meskarune> new version was released yesterday

16:25PM <Meskarune> python 2 is being discontinued

16:25PM <Meskarune> it will not be maintained past 2020, so its a good idea to learn python 3

16:26PM <Meskarune> learn python the hard way - recently updated to python 3

16:29PM <Meskarune> here is ipython 3

16:30PM <Meskarune> for running python2 you can run ipython2

16:30PM <Meskarune> it has to be installed sepperately

16:31PM <Klariset> I also think it's good to mention about PsychoPy, maybe at the end, it's always interesting when two different worlds meet together and it can inspire others. â˜º

16:37PM <Meskarune> on the video I just see the pypi site

16:54PM <Klariset> Not sure if it's cause of the delay, but I couldn't see anything, only "Practice begins!" screen.
